    <p> Hello! My name is Tegan and I am training with FutureProof's Kurita Cohort to become a Junior Full Stack Development Engineer! <br/><br/>
        I graduated from the University of Sheffield last year with a Bachelors in Bioengineering, specialising in Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials! I've always had a keen interest in tech and STEM subjects so I'm really looking forward to learning this new skillset and building a career from it!
